### Election Voting System

The Election Voting System is a web application developed in React using Redux Toolkit with Vite. It allows users to view a list of candidates, vote for a candidate, and display the results of the election. The system uses Axios for API handling to communicate with a mockapi.io backend server.

#### Features

- **User Authentication:** Users must authenticate themselves to access the system. Administrators have additional permissions for managing the election.
- **Voter Features:** Users can view the list of candidates, view candidate profiles, submit votes, and receive a confirmation message after voting.
- **Candidate Features:** Candidates can edit their own profiles, provide campaign updates, and monitor the election results.
- **Admin Features:** Administrators can manage candidates, view real-time voting statistics, verify the vote count, manage user accounts and permissions, and generate reports.
